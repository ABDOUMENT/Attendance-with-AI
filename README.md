# Attendance-with-AI
In this project, you will find the backend developed in Python for an attendance application that uses AI (CNN-based face recognition).
This repository contains only the backend code — **no training data is included**.

## Dataset Requirements

To run this project, you need to prepare your own dataset:

1. Create a folder named `Dataset`
2. Place all face images inside this folder
3. Create a CSV file named `dataset.csv`

### CSV Format

The CSV file must contain:

- The image file name
- The person’s name associated with that image
